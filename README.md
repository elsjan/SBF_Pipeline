# SBF_Pipeline
Pipeline implemented to measure Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) in various HST passbands.

The main functions are stored in the file sbf_pipeline.py. In this folder, imports of the individual functions
are made from the "functions" folder. This stores the functions required for each sub-processing step.

An example of how to run the algorithm is supplied in the folder "example". There a notebook is stored that 
shows the basic syntacs and file structure required for a proper run of the sbf pipeline.
